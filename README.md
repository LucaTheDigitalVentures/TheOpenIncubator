### WIP -- Looking for a logo -- > open a ticket and suggest one :)

## Intro

Why? and who is this thing for? :)

Many times you, as an individual have an idea about a software solution, but it requires skills that you don't have available right now or the money to "rent" them, this open-source initiative is for you.

Many times as CVC (corporate venture capital) you are looking for startups that can help reach your goals quicker and more efficiently than your current capabilities, this is for you as well :)

Many times...... You are working on an open-source project for a few years but never found a way to make it an actual business,
this is for you as well :)

Ok, most repetitive message ever ... in short: collab space between, founders, CVC, and open software community.
